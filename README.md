# Introduction

VirtualMetric is a realtime monitoring, change tracking and inventory reporting software that is flexible and easy to use. You can configure and start monitoring in minutes. You don't need to install any agent on monitored servers. VirtualMetric provides complete visibility with its pre-configured more than 800 performance counters and detailed inventory scannings.

VirtualMetric also supports many hardware manufacturers to troubleshoot physical server issues like hard disk, processor, memory etc. You can read [Bare Metal Hardware](https://cloud.virtualmetric.com/Documentation#serverpre-configuration-baremetalhardware) section to see supported hardware models.

* VirtualMetric uses [ WS-Man](https://www.dmtf.org/standards/ws-man) protocol to connect and monitor **Windows** servers, therefore, allowing HTTP/HTTPS ports on firewall is enough to start monitoring.
* VirtualMetric uses [ VMware vSphere Web Services](https://www.vmware.com/support/developer/vc-sdk/) to connect and monitor **VMware** **servers**. Allowing HTTP/HTTPS ports on firewall is enough to start monitoring.
