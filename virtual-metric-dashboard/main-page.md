VirtualMetric Dashboard is the HTML based web interface to access VirtualMetric. This web interface is highly interactive, using Javascript to deliver a powerful and easy-to-use user experience. While you are logged in, the VirtualMetric Dashboard permanently refreshes the data on the screen permanently (via Ajax calls) so it always shows the current monitoring results (you can set refresh interval).
