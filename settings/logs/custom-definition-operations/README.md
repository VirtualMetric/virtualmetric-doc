# Custom Definition Operations

Custom Definitions is the group of definitions which can be used to determine which logs will be gathered from target servers, filtering options and settings that VirtualMetric will use to collect logs. You can enable and disable the log providers and apply filtering options on log providers, so VirtualMetric Collector can use these definitions to collect the appropriate logs from the target servers. Changing definition settings will be immediately applied to VirtualMetric Collectors.

In this section, you will learn following operations:

* Add a custom definition fields
* Edit custom definition
* Remove a definition
