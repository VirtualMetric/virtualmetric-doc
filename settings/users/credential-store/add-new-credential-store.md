Select an Action Type from the field. The Action Type refers to a different method or mechanism for authentication, and each has its own set of actions or operations associated with it. You can see an array of Action Type such as Basic, SSH key based, Cyberark, SNMPv2, SNMPv3, API Key, Bearer Token, HMAC, HTTP Header, etc. Let's see how we can create each of these Action Type.&#x20;

## **Basic**&#x20;

Select Basic option from the dropdown menu. You get the following screen:&#x20;
