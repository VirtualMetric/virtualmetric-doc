<table><thead><tr><th width="217">Fields</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Name </td><td>A label or name that is assigned to a listener. </td></tr><tr><td>Trigger</td><td>You may want to assign the servers to a custom Trigger if target server is in an Isolated network or if you want to setup a scalable infrastructure. You will only see available Triggers in this field.</td></tr><tr><td>IP Address </td><td>The numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network is called an "IP address." An IP address is typically represented in the format XXX.XXX.XXX.XX, where each "XXX" is a number ranging from 0 to 255, and the "XX" is a similar two-digit number. IP addresses are used to uniquely identify and locate devices on a network. </td></tr><tr><td>Port Number </td><td> A specific endpoint for data exchange between two devices or applications within a network. </td></tr><tr><td>Credential Type</td><td><p>Select a proper credential type and credential.</p><p>·       <strong>None</strong></p><p>·       <strong>Basic:</strong> Selecting this option provides you with another Field called Credential from where you can select an appropriate option. </p><p>·       <strong>HMAC:</strong> It is a specific type of message authentication code (MAC) that uses a cryptographic hash function along with a secret key to create a fixed-size hash value (digest) from the input data.</p><p>·       <strong>HTTP Header:</strong> It is an authentication method which is included in the HTTP message as key-value pairs and is transmitted as part of the HTTP protocol. </p></td></tr><tr><td>SSL Public Key</td><td>This field only appears when enabled TLS is active. An SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) public key is used for encryption and is shared openly, allowing others to encrypt data that can only be decrypted by the corresponding private key.</td></tr><tr><td>SSL Private Key</td><td>This field only appears when enabled TLS is active. The SSL private key, kept confidential, is used for decrypting data encrypted with the associated public key, ensuring secure communication between parties.</td></tr><tr><td>Response Code</td><td>Indicating the status of a received HTTP request</td></tr><tr><td>Content-Type</td><td>The HTTP listener Content-Type specifies the type and format of the data being sent or received. Example: “application/json”, “text/html”</td></tr><tr><td>Response Body</td><td>The HTTP listener response body contains the data or content sent by the server in response to an HTTP request.</td></tr><tr><td>URL</td><td>It is a web address that specifies the location of a resource on the internet.</td></tr><tr><td>Log Interval</td><td><p>The interval for fetching data.</p><p>·       Realtime</p><p>·       1 Minute</p><p>·       3 Minutes</p><p>·       5 Minutes</p></td></tr><tr><td>Status </td><td><p>To choose a server status such as: </p><p>·       <strong>Active:</strong> Enables monitoring for server</p><p>·       <strong>Maintenance:</strong> Enables maintenance mode for server and disables all notifications</p><p>·       <strong>Reconnect:</strong> Restarts all collectors for server</p><p>·       <strong>Disabled:</strong> Disables monitoring for server</p></td></tr><tr><td>Debug </td><td><p>To choose debug such as:</p><p>·       <strong>Off</strong></p><p>·       <strong>On:</strong> Collects debug logs for Inventory and Monitoring Collector</p></td></tr></tbody></table>
