<table><thead><tr><th width="219">Fields </th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Hostname </td><td>A label or name that is assigned to a workstation. </td></tr><tr><td>Server Type </td><td>Workstation types such as Windows, Linux </td></tr><tr><td>Trigger</td><td>You may want to assign the servers to a custom Trigger if target server is in an Isolated network or if you want to setup a scalable infrastructure. You will only see available Triggers in this field.</td></tr><tr><td>FQDN / IP Address </td><td><p> <br>FQDN represents the complete domain name of a machine or application on a network.
