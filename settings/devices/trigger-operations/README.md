# Trigger Operations

You can install many VirtualMetric Triggers to monitor servers in the isolated networks like NAT, NVGRE, Virtual Network etc. After installing a new VirtualMetric Trigger, you can create a Trigger definition on VirtualMetric Dashboard. VirtualMetric Trigger is responsible to open connections to servers and run Collector scripts to fetch monitoring and inventory data from servers.

In this section, you will learn following operations:

* Adding a Trigger to start monitoring
* Assigning Triggers modules on Servers, Clusters etc.
* Editing the Trigger
* Changing API User
* Removing a Trigger
* Enabling Debug
