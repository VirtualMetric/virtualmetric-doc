An IP address is typically represented in the format XXX.XXX.XXX.XX, where each "XXX" is a number ranging from 0 to 255, and the "XX" is a similar two-digit number. IP addresses are used to uniquely identify and locate devices on a network.</td></tr><tr><td>Database Name</td><td>Unique identifier for a collection of organized data within a database management system, distinguishing it from other databases within the same environment.</td></tr><tr><td>Credential Type</td><td><p>Select a proper credential type and credential.</p><p>·       <strong>None:</strong> Select this type and add Username and Password </p><p>·       <strong>Basic:</strong> Selecting this option provides you with another Field called Credential from where you can select an appropriate option.  </p><p>·       <strong>Cyberark:</strong> Selecting this option provides you with another Field called Credential from where you can select an appropriate option. </p></td></tr><tr><td>Trigger</td><td>You may want to assign the servers to a custom Trigger if target server is in an Isolated network or if you want to setup a scalable infrastructure. You will only see available Triggers in this field.</td></tr><tr><td>Port</td><td>A specific endpoint for data exchange between two devices or applications within a network.</td></tr><tr><td>Inventory Interval</td><td><p>This option defines frequency of Inventory Collector. Inventory Collector is responsible for: </p><p>·       Collecting server inventory like pending updates, installed applications, local administrators etc. </p><p>·       Collecting module inventory like virtual machines, web sites, databases etc. </p><p>·       Hardware Health Monitoring </p><p>·       Windows Firewall Logs </p><p>·       Change Tracking </p></td></tr><tr><td>Stats Interval</td><td><p>This option defines frequency of Monitoring Collector.
