# Adding Dependency

Dependencies can be added to **rules**, ensuring that even if another event occurs, the dependent event **won't be activated until the required event happens**.

1\.      To add a dependency, go to **Notification > Rules**, Click on buttons to **Dependency.**

2\.      Choose the notification rule you want from the notification rule field, then click **">>"** to move it to the Dependencies field and then click the **Submit** button. Now the selected rule will be dependent to that rule. To **remove** a dependency, click on the rule, and then click the **"<<"** button.
