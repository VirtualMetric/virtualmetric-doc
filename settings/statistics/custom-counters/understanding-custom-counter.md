_**Notification Options**_

In the Custom Counter settings, you can enable or disable all alerting systems including Email, SMS and Heatmap. By modifying thresholds of the counters, you can set their threshold limits and enable them on heatmap or activate notifications.

If you enable thresholds for a custom counter, you should also set threshold limits to activate. You can also choose to receive notifications or see their health status on Heatmap

_**Thresholds**_

If thresholds option is enabled, VirtualMetric uses notification thresholds to determine counter health status which are healthy, monitor, warning or critical.

VirtualMetric offers **4 different** **Thresholds** for alerting:

* &#x20;  _Healthy:_ That means counter is in recommended thresholds and considered as healthy
* &#x20;  _Monitor:_ That means counter is not in recommended thresholds but also it is not in danger zone. You should monitor activity of this counter because soon it may be in warning thresholds.
* &#x20;  _Warning:_ That means counter is in warning thresholds and considered as not healthy. You should troubleshoot issue before counter gets into critical level.
* &#x20;  _Critical:_ That means counter is in critical thresholds and considered as not healthy. Counter is in critical state so you must troubleshoot issue fast before your system becomes unresponsive

VirtualMetric comes with some pre-defined threshold limits based on Microsoft and VMware recommendations.
