## _**User Permissions - vSphere**_

If you want to use non-administrator user for VMware operations, you need to add and configure the following User and Role permissions according to your environment.

**Creating User**

Create your user from Local Users & Groups tab.

Click Add New User and type new user information.

<div align="left">

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (33).png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

</div>

**Creating Role**

You need to create a new role for your user.

Go to Home view.

<div align="left">

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (34).png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

</div>

Click on Roles icon.

<div align="left">

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (35).png" alt="" width="460"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

</div>

Click Add button to open dialog.

<div align="left">

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (36).png" alt="" width="266"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

</div>

Assign the following permission to your user role:

```markup
Global > Settings
Host > CIM > CIM Interaction
Host > Configuration > System Management
Virtual Machine > Interaction > Console Interaction
```

\
For VMware 6.5 and later versions, you should also add following permission:

```markup
Virtual Machine > Interaction > Inject USB HID scan codes
```

\
After you add permissions, you will see following User Role view.

After that, you should add the new user to the user role as a member.

<div align="left">

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (37).png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

</div>

Click Add button, select the user and click OK button to apply changes.

<div align="left">

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (38).png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

</div>

## _**User Permissions - vCenter**_

If you want to use non-administrator user for vCenter operations, you need to add and configure the following User and Role permissions according to your environment.\
\
**Creating User**

First, we will start with adding a new user.

Go to Administration tab.

<div align="left">

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (39).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

</div>

From Users and Groups section, click + button to add a new user.

<div align="left">

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (40).png" alt="" width="439"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

</div>

**Creating Role**

Now you should add a new user role to configure permissions.

From Roles section, click + button to add new a Role.

<div align="left">

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (41).png" alt="" width="383"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

</div>

On the dialog, expand the All Privileges section to add permissions.

<div align="left">

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (42).png" alt="" width="314"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

</div>

Select the following Permissions from the list:

```markup
Global > Settings
Host > CIM > CIM Interaction
Virtual Machine > Interaction > Console Interaction
Virtual Machine > Interaction > Inject USB HID scan codes
```

After Role and User creation, you need to assign the User to the Role.

<div align="left">

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (43).png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

</div>

By default, the new user will have access to all objects in vCenter. If you want to narrow the scope, you can follow the steps below.

Go to Navigator and select Hosts and Clusters.

<div align="left">

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (44).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

</div>

Switch to Permissions tab and complete User-Role Assignment for the scope.
